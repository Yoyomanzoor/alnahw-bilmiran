# النحو بالمران

This project is compiled on Overleaf, but can also be compiled locally.  
I don't plan to pay for Overleaf pro, so currently updated files need to be manually copied to Overleaf.

## Install XeLaTex on Ubuntu

```bash
sudo apt-get install texlive-xetex
sudo apt-get install texlive-lang-arabic
sudo apt-get install texlive-bibtex-extra biber
```

To compile, run `make`.
