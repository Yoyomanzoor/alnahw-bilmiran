# النحو بالمران

This project is compiled on Overleaf, but can also be compiled locally.  
I don't plan to pay for Overleaf pro, so currently updated files need to be manually copied to Overleaf.

## Install XeLaTex on Ubuntu

```bash
sudo apt-get install texlive-xetex texlive-lang-arabic texlive-bibtex-extra biber texlive-fonts-extra
```

To compile, run `make`.
